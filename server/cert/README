HOW TO GENERATE SELF-ASSIGNED CERTIFICATE ON WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT

0. Ensure you are running a CMD in 'Administrator mode'

1. Make sure you have installed openssl.
- E.g if you install git using chocolatey,
- then add this path 'C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin' to the system 'path' environment variable.
- openssl.exe is stored in 'C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin'

2. Generate private key:
- openssl genrsa 2048 > private.pem

3. Change the Encoding of generated 'private.pem' file with notepad++ to UTF-8

4. Generate the self signed certificate:
- openssl req -x509 -days 1000 -new -key private.pem -out public.pem
- enter these details:

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:AT
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Vienna
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Vienna
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Xplorify
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:localhost
Email Address []:admin@xplorify.net


5. Set environment variable for the random file 'RANDFILE' to the path of this folder e.g.:
- set RANDFILE=C:\Dev\xplorify-analytics\server\cert\.rnd

6. Create PFX format of the certificate:
- openssl pkcs12 -export -in public.pem -inkey private.pem -out certificate.pfx
- set password e.g. Xp12345!

7. Store the password from step 6. as encrypted in the .woogeen.keystore by running:
- node ../initcert.js
